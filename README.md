# MTLSys: Latency-aware Pruning for Multi-task Learning

## To run demo:

### Install dependencies

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* [Install Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)


### Download trained model-variants

`gdown "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pG_6ncWFn8Gy4pIaz4Q4EE6JbGmD6RkM"e`
`unzip model-variants.zip`
`cp -r model-variants models/`

### Run the demo notebook

To run the demo of the inference system on small sample dataset - 

* Open the notebook - `inference/demo.ipynb`
* Run all cells
* Wait for a few minutes as profiling takes time.
